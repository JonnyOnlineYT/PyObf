# PyObf
some random Python obfuscator i made in like 2 months

its broken (it only works with smaller projects (1 file))

# Usage

at the bottom of the script you can comment out the transformers you dont want to use. (dont use the number obfuscator... its broken af)

the file is automatically grabbed from the same directory (the scripts name must de "in.py")

after doing some voodoo magic it saves the obfuscated file to "out.py" (same directory again)
